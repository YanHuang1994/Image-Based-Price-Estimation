Slide1: Ok, Let's get started.
	Our project is to develop an Image Based Price Estimation Model.

Slide2: These are our members.

Slide3:
	So far, we have completed the part of 
	Methodology Research, Data Collection, Data Processing, and Benchmark Baseline Model development as planned.

Slide4:
	We reviewed 3 papers and gained some insights.
	From the first article, we learned about the importance of a hybrid CNN-LSTM model for price interval predictions.
	From the second one, we understood the high efficiency of CNN for image-based price prediction.
	Based on the viewpoint from the last article, we decided to concentrate on the Acoustic Guitar as our study focus.

Slide5:
	Then, we collected data by scraping guitar websites.

	We selected Guitar Center as our data source because it offers a comprehensive collection of second-hand guitar images at reasonable prices, 	focusing more on everyday items than luxury products.

Slide6:
we first downloaded the webpages and then scraped guitar images.

Slide7:
	Next, we process the data by four steps
	Remove the background
	Eliminate invalid images
	Crop the images to keep the top soundboard and
	Resize and pad the guitar images

Slide8:
	After processing, we have guitar images of the uniform size for model training

Slide9:
	Finally, we created two models
	One is Two-layer fully connected neural network, acting as a toy model to verify preprocessing steps and dataset splits.
	Another is ResNet-50, as recommended by the slides in class, used to set a performance threshold for future improvements.
Slide10:
	That's our work so far, thank you!
